## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This project aims to perform the *transcriptional analysis* of Haemonchus contortus, a gastrointestinal parasite of veterinary importance.  
The goal is to compare *ivermectin-susceptible (IVM-S)* and *ivermectin-resistant (IVM-R)* strains to identify differences in gene expression associated with drug resistance.
___

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- Compare gene expression profiles between IVM-S and IVM-R strains.  
- Identify differentially expressed genes related to drug resistance.  
- Generate reproducible resources for downstream analyses.

## Methodology

**Research Questions**  
- What transcriptional differences exist between IVM-S and IVM-R *H. contortus* isolates?  
- Which genes or pathways are associated with ivermectin resistance?  
- How can transcriptome data support better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in parasitic nematodes?  

**Steps**  
1. Data source identification (RNA-seq Illumina data from IVM-S and IVM-R strains).  
2. Download and preparation of raw sequencing data.  
3. Quality control and trimming of raw reads (FastQC, Trimmomatic).  
4. Mapping and quantification of transcripts (HISAT2, Salmon/Kallisto).  
5. Differential expression analysis (DESeq2, EdgeR).  
6. Functional annotation (BLAST, InterProScan, GO/KEGG).  
7. Integration and interpretation of results.  

___ 

## Expected Results
 
- Lists of differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant isolates.  
- Functional insights into molecular pathways associated with ivermectin resistance.  
- Reproducible pipelines and scripts deposited in GitHub.  
- A documented workflow for future studies on helminth transcriptomics.  

___

## Requirements Specification

**Functional Requirements**  

- It must quantify transcript expression and perform differential expression analysis.  
- It must annotate genes and provide biological context for differentially expressed transcripts.  
- It must generate reproducible scripts for all steps of the workflow.  

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Scripts must be written in reproducible languages (R, Python, Bash).  
- The workflow should be modular and easy to adapt to other transcriptomic datasets.  
- Output should be well-documented and structured for downstream analyses.  
- Performance should handle large RNA-seq datasets efficiently.  

___

## Analysis and Design

The project will integrate a modular pipeline combining existing bioinformatics tools. Workflow management will focus on data validation, error handling, and reproducibility.  

**Pipeline Design (simplified pseudocode):**
Main Workflow (Transcriptome_Analysis):
Input: Raw RNA-seq reads (IVM-S, IVM-R)
Step 1: Quality_Control(reads)
Step 2: Trim_Reads(reads)
Step 3: Map_and_Quantify(assembly, reads)
Step 4: Differential_Expression(quant_data)
Step 5: Functional_Annotation(diff_exp_genes)
Step 6: Generate_Reports(results)
Output: Expression profiles, annotation, reproducible scripts

- **Actor**: Researcher  
- **Description**: The researcher provides raw RNA-seq data for IVM-S and IVM-R strains. The pipeline validates and processes the data, performs quantification, differential expression, and annotation, and outputs interpretable results.  
- **Main Flow**:  
  1. Input RNA-seq data.  
  2. Quality check and preprocessing.    
  3. Differential expression analysis.  
  4. Functional annotation.  
  5. Results reporting.  

- **Alternative Flows**:  
  - If input data is corrupted â†’ System halts and reports error.  
  - If assembly fails â†’ Provide error log and suggest parameter adjustments.  
  - If no differential expression is detected â†’ Report and flag possible biological/technical causes.
