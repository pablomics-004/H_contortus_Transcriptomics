# Comparative transcriptomics of Haemonchus contortus: ivermectin susceptibility and resistance (IVM-S/IVM-R)
Date: 29/08/2025

This repository contains the bioinformatics pipeline and transcriptomic analysis of Haemonchus contortus, focusing on the molecular basis of ivermectin resistance.
The project compares ivermectin-susceptible (IVM-S) and ivermectin-resistant (IVM-R) strains through RNA-seq differential expression analysis. This project reproduces and extends the analysis from Reyes-Guerrero _et.al_ (2023).

## 📌 Project Description
This project performs a **comparative transcriptomic analysis of Haemonchus contortus**, a hematophagous gastrointestinal nematode that causes severe economic losses in livestock.
The study focuses on comparing **ivermectin-susceptible (IVM-S)** and **ivermectin-resistant (IVM-R)** strains to identify **differentially expressed genes (DEGs)** that may underlie anthelmintic resistance mechanisms. Understanding these molecular signatures is crucial for improving parasite control strategies and delaying the spread of drug resistance in field populations.

Ultimately, this project aims to provide a **reproducible computational framework for transcriptomic studies** , enabling future research on drug resistance, gene regulation, and parasite adaptation mechanisms.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Compare gene expression profiles between IVM-S and IVM-R strains.

## Methodology

**Research Questions**  
- What transcriptional differences exist between IVM-S and IVM-R *H. contortus* isolates?  
- Which genes or pathways are associated with ivermectin resistance?  
- How can transcriptome data support better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms in parasitic nematodes?  

**Steps**  
1. Data source identification (RNA-seq Illumina data from IVM-S and IVM-R strains).  
2. Download and preparation of raw sequencing data.  
3. Quality control and trimming of raw reads (FastQC, Trimmomatic, Cutadpat).  
4. Mapping and quantification of transcripts (HISAT2, Salmon/Kallisto, BWA).  
5. Differential expression analysis (DESeq2, EdgeR).  
6. Functional annotation (BLAST, InterProScan, GO/KEGG).  
7. Integration and interpretation of results.  

___ 

## Expected Results
 
- Lists of differentially expressed genes between susceptible and resistant isolates.  
- Functional insights into molecular pathways associated with ivermectin resistance.  
- Reproducible pipelines and scripts deposited in GitHub.  
- A documented workflow for future studies on helminth transcriptomics.  

___

## Requirements Specification

**Functional Requirements**  

- It must quantify transcript expression and perform differential expression analysis.  
- It must annotate genes and provide biological context for differentially expressed transcripts.  
- It must generate reproducible scripts for all steps of the workflow.  

**Non-Functional Requirements**  
- Scripts must be written in reproducible languages (R, Python, Bash).  
- The workflow should be modular and easy to adapt to other transcriptomic datasets.  
- Output should be well-documented and structured for downstream analyses.  
- Performance should handle large RNA-seq datasets efficiently.

## Analysis and Design

The project will integrate a modular pipeline combining existing bioinformatics tools. Workflow management will focus on data validation, error handling, and reproducibility.  

**Pipeline Design (simplified pseudocode):**
Main Workflow (Transcriptome_Analysis):
Input: Raw RNA-seq reads (IVM-S, IVM-R)
Step 1: Quality_Control(reads)
Step 2: Trim_Reads(reads)
Step 3: Map_and_Quantify(assembly, reads)
Step 4: Differential_Expression(quant_data)
Step 5: Functional_Annotation(diff_exp_genes)
Step 6: Generate_Reports(results)
Output: Expression profiles, annotation, reproducible scripts

- **Actor**: Researcher  
- **Description**: The researcher provides raw RNA-seq data for IVM-S and IVM-R strains. The pipeline validates and processes the data, performs quantification, differential expression, and annotation, and outputs interpretable results.  
- **Main Flow**:  
  1. Input RNA-seq data.  
  2. Quality check and preprocessing.    
  3. Differential expression analysis.  
  4. Functional annotation.  
  5. Results reporting.  

- **Alternative Flows**:  
  - If input data is corrupted → System halts and reports error.  
  - If assembly fails → Provide error log and suggest parameter adjustments.  
  - If no differential expression is detected → Report and flag possible biological/technical causes.
