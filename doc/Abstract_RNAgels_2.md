**Abstract**

*Haemonchus contortus* is a blood-feeding gastrointestinal nematode of small ruminants and one of the most important parasites in tropical and temperate grazing systems. Its high prevalence and pathogenicity, combined with the widespread development of anthelmintic resistance (AR), make it a critical model for studying resistance mechanisms. In particular, resistance to ivermectin, a macrocyclic lactone widely used in veterinary medicine, has been reported across many populations of *H. contortus*.

The study by *Reyes-Guerrero et al.* (2023) focused on assembling and analyzing the transcriptome of two Mexican *H. contortus* strains with contrasting ivermectin resistance profiles: a susceptible strain (IVMs) and a resistant strain (IVMr). Using RNA-Seq on adult males, a high-quality de novo transcriptome assembly was generated, comprising approximately 127 Mbp and 77,422 transcripts. From these, 27,324 genes were identified as differentially expressed between the resistant and susceptible strains, of which 13,623 could be functionally annotated.

Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed distinct expression profiles between strains. The resistant strain (IVMr) showed upregulation of genes related to efflux transporters (especially ABC transporters), ATPase-coupled transmembrane activity, xenobiotic detoxification, muscle contraction and locomotion, all of which are consistent with molecular mechanisms that reduce ivermectin efficacy. In contrast, the susceptible strain (IVMs) displayed upregulated genes associated with nutrient storage, metabolic processes, embryonic development, and reproductive biology.

 	This transcriptome resource highlights the complex genetic basis of ivermectin resistance and provides candidate genes that may serve as biomarkers of resistance, molecular targets for drug development, or even potential vaccine antigens. More broadly, the study emphasizes the importance of transcriptomic approaches in understanding adaptation and survival strategies in parasitic nematodes.

**Objectives**

***General objective***

* To  analyze the transcriptome of *Haemonchus contortus* strains with different ivermectin susceptibility profiles, in order to identify differentially expressed genes and provide insight into the molecular basis of anthelmintic resistance.

*Specific objectives*

* To obtain and process raw sequencing data (*fastq* files) from resistant and susceptible *H. contortus* isolates.  
* To perform *de novo* transcriptome assembly or, alternatively, use available reference genomes/transcriptomes where appropriate.  
* To align reads from biological replicates against the assembled transcriptome and generate a reliable count matrix.  
* To conduct differential expression analysis between resistant and susceptible strains.  
* To functionally annotate differentially expressed genes using BLAST searches at the nucleotide and protein levels.  
* To interpret transcriptomic data in the context of resistance mechanisms, identifying candidate genes and pathways relevant to ivermectin response.

**BioProject ID**

The sequencing data associated with the reference study are available under GenBank *BioProject ID: PRJNA877658.*

**Reference organism**

Reference genomes for *H. contortus* exist, such as the MHco3 (ISE) and NZ\_Hco\_NP assemblies. However, when the Mexican isolates were aligned against these references, the mapping percentage was low (\~56%). Due to this limitation, the study generated a de novo transcriptome assembly to avoid losing biologically relevant transcripts and to better capture the genetic diversity of local populations. This approach allowed the identification of more comprehensive transcriptomic information relevant to ivermectin resistance.

**Expected results**

For the current class project, based on the workflow proposed, the following outcomes are expected:
  
* **Differential expression profiling**, identifying sets of genes upregulated in resistant versus susceptible parasites.  
* **Functional annotation** of candidate genes using BLAST, focusing on key families such as ABC transporters, ligand-gated ion channels, and detoxification enzymes (cytochrome P450s, glutathione-S-transferases).  
* **Biological interpretation** of transcriptomic signatures, linking gene expression changes to resistance mechanisms (e.g., efflux activity, neuromuscular regulation, xenobiotic metabolism).  
* Contribution to the identification of **molecular markers** for diagnosing resistance and potential **targets for novel control strategies**, such as vaccine candidates or drugs designed to overcome efflux-mediated resistance.

By generating and analyzing transcriptomic data, the project will help deepen our understanding of ivermectin resistance in *H. contortus* and provide valuable information for designing sustainable parasite control strategies in livestock production systems.
