Title: Haemonchus contortus IVM Susceptible/Resistant Mexican Transcriptome, INIFAP-Mexico
Accession: PRJNA877658
Description: The trasnscriptome of two H. contortus mexican isolates (IVM Susceptible and Resistant) was assembled to analyze its potential use in the establishment of strategies of control of haemonchosis in small ruminants based on identifying and usage of genes associated with anthelmintic resistance.
Data Type: Transcriptome or Gene expression
Submitter: National Reserch Institute for Forestry, Agriculture and Livestock
